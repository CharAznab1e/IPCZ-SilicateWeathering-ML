# IPCZ-SilicateWeathering-ML
This program implements a multi-model ensemble approach that combines five machine learning algorithms to predict silicate weathering fluxes with enhanced robustness and accuracy. The ensemble employs R²-weighted averaging, where better-performing models contribute more to the final prediction.
